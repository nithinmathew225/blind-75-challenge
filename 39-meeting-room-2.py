"""Question
Meeting Rooms II
Solved 
Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), find the minimum number of days required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [(0,40),(5,10),(15,20)]

Output: 2
Explanation:
day1: (0,40)
day2: (5,10),(15,20)

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [(4,9)]

Output: 1
Note:

(0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8
Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 500
0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000
